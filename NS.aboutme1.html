    <p class=body>My main hobby is music, I've played piano and drums since I was four, guitar since I was eight, and learned bass and proper vocal techniques over the pandemic. This is an image of one of the first venues I performed at a few times when I was around ten.</p>

    <p class=body>I enjoy being a Guitar Luthier, both repairing/modifying my own guitars and building new ones from scratch. So far I've built two guitars.</p>
